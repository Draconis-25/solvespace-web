Workflow
--------

Before you start, fork the `solvespace-web` repository and clone it into any convenient directory:

    git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/solvespace-web

Then, verify that the prerequisites are installed correctly by running `make`. If this command
succeeds, open the `html/index.html` file in your browser.

You can modify the website as follows:

  1. Change a `.pl` file to modify a page, or add an asset to `pics`, `vids` or `dl`;
  2. (Re)generate HTML for every page and copy assets by invoking `make`;
  3. Verify that the change is correct;
  4. Commit the change and send a pull request.
